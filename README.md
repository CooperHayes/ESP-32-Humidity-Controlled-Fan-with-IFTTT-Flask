# ESP-32-Humidity-Controlled-Fan-with-IFTTT-Email-Alert-Implementation
A DHT22 is used to take humidity readings that are then displayed on a .96 OLED display and compared to threshold to turn a 5V fan on or off. By utilizing the ESP-32's ability to connect to WiFi and set web requests to websites, the ESP32 send a webhook request to an IFTTT URL, which then sends an email to a Gmail inbox

## Project Overview

This system continuously monitors local humidity using a humidity sensor connected to an ESP32. When the measured humidity rises above the level determined by the potentiometer , the the ESP32 sends a signal to the MOSFET gate which then allows for current to flow through the 5V fan. Once humidity falls below the threshold, the fan is switched off automatically.

The goal of the project is to provide a simple, low-cost environmental control that operates without manual intervention and alerts users automatically.

## Features

* Real-time humidity monitoring
* Automatic fan activation
* Digital presentation of temperature and humidity
* Adjustable humidity thresholds

## Wiring

A complete wiring diagram is provided in the repository documentation. Refer to the diagrams folder for detailed wiring diagrams, pin assignments, and component connections.

The wiring diagram illustrates:

* Humidity sensor connections
* MOSFET connections
* Resistor placement
* OLED display connections
* Poteintometer connections
* ESP32 pin assignments
* Flyback diode placement


## How It Works

1. The humidity sensor measures the surrounding air humidity.
2. The ESP32 reads the sensor value.
3. A threshold is determined by the position of a potentiometer knob
4. If humidity exceeds the threshold:
   * Fan turns ON.
5. If humidity does not exceed the threshold:
   * Fan turns OFF.
6. The cycle repeats continuously.


## Software

The project is programmed using the Arduino IDE.

Required libraries:

* DHT Sensor Library
* Adafruit Unified Sensor Library
* Adafruit GFX Library
* Wire Library
* WiFi Library
* HTTPClient

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `.ino` file in Arduino IDE.
3. Install required libraries.
4. Input personal wifi name and password
5. Connect the hardware according to the wiring diagram.
6. Configure an applet on IFTTT with an "if this" as "Recieve a webhook request" and a "then that" as "Send me an email".
7. Paste webhook url given by IFTTT into http.GET()
8. Upload the sketch to the ESP32 board.

## Results

The system successfully controlled a fan based on humidity readings and automatically sent email alerts, demonstrating automated environmental regulation with minimal hardware and allowed for safe power consumption through the use of a MOSFET.
